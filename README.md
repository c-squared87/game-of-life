# game-of-life

This is my JS implementation of the Conway game of life project.

User Story: When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.

User Story: I can start and stop the board.

User Story: I can set up the board.

User Story: I can clear the board.

User Story: When I press start, the game will play out.

User Story: Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.

This is a test update! Again!
